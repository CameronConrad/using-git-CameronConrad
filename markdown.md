# Using Markdown

I am demonstrating different formatting styles using markdown.

## Styles of text

**This is bold text.** *This is italicized text.* ~This is mistaken text.~ ***This is very important text!*** 

## Quotes

The great philosopher Cameron Conrad once said:

> This is an example of a quote in markdown.

## Code

This is a code example:

```python
class Example:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
    
    def add(self):
        return self.x + self.y
```

## Colors

This is the color purple: `rgb(255, 0, 255)`
